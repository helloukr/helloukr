[![Procedure for those seeking Protection originating from Ukraine (S-Status)](/assets/img/flowchart-{{ page.lang }}.png)](https://www.sem.admin.ch/dam/sem/de/data/asyl/faktenblatt-zusammenarbeit-bund-kantone.pdf.download.pdf/faktenblatt-zusammenarbeit-bund-kantone-d.pdf)

## Registration / Protection Status S
Switzerland is helping vulnerable people who have fled Ukraine quickly and unbureaucratically. All persons who were resident in Ukraine before February 24 receive the **protection status S** – there is no quota!

#### We recommend that all those seeking protection submit an application as soon as possible
To do this, you must register at a federal asylum centre.
But you don't have to do that today and tomorrow – you have up to 90 days to do so. **After submitting the application, the person seeking protection has health insurance.**

#### What does the protection status "S" mean?
With the protection status "S", affected persons receive protection in Switzerland quickly and unbureaucratically – without carrying out an ordinary asylum procedure. The protection status "S" grants a right of residence, entitlement to accommodation, support and medical care and allows the reunification of family members. And very important: the children can go to school.

- With the protection status S the persons concerned receive an identity card S ([Art. 45 AsylV 1](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/359/de#art_45)). It's validity is limited to a maximum of one year and can be extended. After five years at the earliest, persons in need of protection receive a residence permit B, which is limited in time until the temporary protection is lifted. ([Art. 74 AsylG](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/de#art_74)).
- The protection status S grants the persons concerned a right of residence, they can join their family members and are entitled to accommodation, support and medical care - the same as provisionally admitted persons. Children can go to school.
- With protection status S, the persons concerned are allowed to travel abroad and return to Switzerland without a permit (Art. 9 para. 8 E-RDV).
- With the protection status S, the persons concerned receive social assistance and they have the possibility to pursue a gainful activity requiring a permit (also a self-employed activity) but without any waiting period.
- The cantons receive the global lump sum 1 ([Art. 22 AsylV 2](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/360/de#art_22)) from the federal government for persons with status S - this includes a share for rental costs, social assistance and care costs, health insurance premiums, etc.
- Status S is a return-oriented status. The federal government creates the conditions for future return (see [Art. 67 AsylG](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1999/358/de#art_67)).
