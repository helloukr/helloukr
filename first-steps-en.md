## Arrival


## Registration / Protection Status S
Switzerland is helping vulnerable people who have fled Ukraine quickly and unbureaucratically. All persons who were resident in Ukraine before February 24 receive the **protection status S** – there is no quota!

#### What does the protection status "S" mean?
With the protection status "S", affected persons receive protection in Switzerland quickly and unbureaucratically – without carrying out an ordinary asylum procedure. The protection status "S" grants a right of residence, entitlement to accommodation, support and medical care and allows the reunification of family members. And very important: the children can go to school.

#### We recommend that all those seeking protection submit an application as soon as possible
To do this, you must register at a federal asylum centre. 
But you don't have to do that today and tomorrow – you have up to 90 days to do so. **After submitting the application, the person seeking protection has health insurance.**
