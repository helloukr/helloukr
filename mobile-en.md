## Getting a SIM Card & Subscription
All SIM cards in Switzerland need to be registered with a **valid official document**.
Drivers licenses are not accepted. Often SIM cards for contracts imply a setup fee of up to CHF 40.-.
There are three major network providers and a number of smaller service providers using one of those networks.
Salt, Sunrise and Swisscom are the network providers.
Sunrise and Swisscom have the best coverage, Salt usually has the cheapest offers.
